# Macroboost


![](./macrotrack-example.png)

My final project for The Iron Yard! A macronutrient diet tracker application. Built with React, MobX, MaterialUI, and some [Rebass](http://jxnblk.com/rebass/). Libraries include [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) and [Moments](https://momentjs.com/). API powered by [Nutritionix API](https://www.nutritionix.com/business/api).
